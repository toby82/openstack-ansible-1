## The default networking requires several bridges. These bridges were named to be informative
## however they can be named what ever you like and is adaptable to any network infrastructure
## environment. This file serves as an example of how to setup basic networking and was ONLY
## built for the purpose of being an example.

# EXAMPLE INTERFACE FILE
# 1293 - HOST_NET (Ignore This. It's the native VLAN.)
# 2176 - CONTAINER_NET
# 1998 - OVERLAY_NET
# 2144 - STORAGE_NET
# 2146 - GATEWAY_NET (VM Provider Network. Ignore this. OpenStack will tag for us.)

## Physical interface, could be bond. This only needs to be set once for the physical device
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet manual
    bond-master bond0
    bond-primary eth0

auto eth1
iface eth1 inet manual
    bond-master bond1
    bond-primary eth1

auto eth2
iface eth2 inet manual
    bond-master bond0

auto eth3
iface eth3 inet manual
    bond-master bond1

auto eth4
iface eth4 inet manual


## Create a bonded interface. Note that the "bond-slaves" is set to none. This is because the
# bond-master has already been set in the raw interfaces for the new bond0.
auto bond0
iface bond0 inet static
    bond-slaves none

    address 10.240.0.100
    netmask 255.255.252.0
    gateway 10.240.0.1
    dns-nameservers 69.20.0.164 69.20.0.196

    bond-mode active-backup
    bond-miimon 100

## Vlan tagged interface, this should be physical interface along with the vlan tag
# The vlan tag number should reflect your already setup vlans.

#STORAGE_NET
iface bond0.2144 inet manual
    vlan-raw-device bond0

#CONTAINER_NET
iface bond0.2176 inet manual

#OVERLAY_NET
iface bond1.1998 inet manual
